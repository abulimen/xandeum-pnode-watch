# Overview

The Ingolstadt release in Xandeum's South Era shifts focus to reward tracking and performance incentives, introducing a heartbeat credit systems, useing metrics to assess pNode performance.  This heartbeat mechanism is the basis of pNodes earning monthly XAND allocations and, later ensuring fair STOINC distribution.

## The begining of performance measuring

Ingolstadt zeroes in on credit tracking for DevNet rewards, allocating 10,000 XAND monthly to high-performing pNodes.&#x20;

Xandeum's Heartbeat Credit System rewards pNode performance with +1 credit per successful 30s signal and -100 on failures, enabling merit-based STOINC and monthly rollovers for fair incentives on Solana.

## Ingolstadt Summary

Ingolstadt represents a pivotal milestone in Xandeum's North Era. Shifting the pNode focus toward reward tracking and performance incentives, Ingolstadt adds credit systems, analyzable metrics, and enables merit-based delegation for storage-enabled dApps (sedApps).

Ingolstadt's rollout builds on Herrenberg's advancements and prepares for mainnet by emphasizing reliability, with integration into the Foundation Delegation Program for XAND staking.

With credit tracking in place, the era advances to Stuttgart (v0.6) for redundancy, adding fault tolerance and preparing full mainnet rollout by late 2025. This paves the way for expanded sedApps and ecosystem auctions.

## Additional Enhancements and Community Focus

Ingolstadt also updates analytics tools, improving pNode oversight and providing real-time performance visibility. Emphasis is placed on monthly rollovers for fair credit distribution.

The release fosters ecosystem growth, with potential for future integrations like AI-driven analytics and expanded community dashboards on xandeum.network.
