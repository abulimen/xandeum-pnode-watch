## State of Development Post-Ingolstadt&#x20;

Ingolstadt (v0.5) marks a critical advancement in Xandeum's South Era, shifting focus to sophisticated reward tracking and performance-based incentives for DevNet pNodes, building on Herrenberg's connectivity foundations, it introduces credit systems for heartbeats (e.g., +1 per successful 30s signal, -100 on failures) and allocates 10,000 XAND monthly to top performers, this contributes to the STOINC calculations. This fosters fair, data-driven delegation via the Foundation Program, positioning Xandeum closer to mainnet by emphasizing reliability metrics like uptime and efficiency.
