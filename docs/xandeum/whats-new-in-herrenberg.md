## State of Development Post-Herrenberg

Building on Munich's operational pNode prototype, Herrenberg introduces advanced network features including a gossip protocol for dynamic pNode communication within pods, ensuring efficient data shard distribution and resilience through vNode monitoring.&#x20;

The pRPC interface enables programmatic access to storage via Xandeum Web3.js, simplifying sedApp development, while achieving full data reconstructability with erasure coding for exabyte-scale, tamper-proof reliability.&#x20;

Crude search capabilities add basic querying to storage buckets, and custom analytics expand insights into pNode performance, all supported by an updated GUI and security enhancements.

- Custom analytics for staker insights and performance optimization
- Enhanced security and GUI for pNode management

This continues Xandeum's commitment to solving the blockchain storage trilemma of scalability, smart contract native, and random access.

Herrenberg marks a transformative step in Xandeum's South Era, redirecting pNode development toward robust network interconnectivity, data resilience, and streamlined tools for sedApp creators. By embedding analyzable frameworks for performance monitoring and system diagnostics, it enables seamless creation of storage-enabled dApps, addressing real-world needs like low-latency queries in decentralized environments. The release aligned with a high-stakes Dutch Auction, selling 52 Deep South pNodes to raise foundation funds and debut NFT multipliers boosting STOINC rewards up to 11x, empowering early operators with amplified earnings based on uptime and contributions. This not only motivates sustained participation but also establishes a solid base for Ingolstadt's performance-based reward mechanisms and Stuttgart's advanced redundancy protocols, ensuring fault-tolerant operations as Xandeum accelerates toward mainnet deployment in late 2025.
